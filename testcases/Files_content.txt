Files from 1 to 7: unsolvable

Files from 8 to 10: already solved maps, just to test if we can return solution straight away

Files from 11 to 45: solvable maps
 11->30 beginner level (1->5 moves)
 31->40 slightly harder, but still easy (more moves, but people can see the solution by "brain-traversal")
 41->45 hard, may need more than 15 moves
